SmartMirror
===========

Motion controlled SmartMirror showing time and temperature in background with the possibility of adding any widget to the menu.
The camera is behind the two-way mirror to get the best possible look. The screen and camera are managed by a raspberry pi.
The motion is managed by a server running in python with OpenCV, the server web is in NodeJS.<br><br>

### Preview
Showing the display of the main menu and a use case on the widget Cinema (movie times of my local theater)

### Capacities
- Recognition of gestures : palm, thumbs up/down, slide up/down/right/left
- Time and outside temperature
- Widgets :
  - Photo : take a photo and upload it to Dropbox
  - Map : display local Google Map
  - Cinema : movie time of local theater
  - DoodleJump : play the game (hard with the latency)
  - News : show international news
  
### Debugging
The motion server can't recognize gestures on a new environment : lights, hand colors... affect the process, that's why by launching
the test.py file and tweak the HSV min/max values and others configs properly you can set it up for your home. To begin the tracking make an open palm like shown in the picture below.

### Dependencies
- Software :
  - OpenCV 2.x
  - Python 3.x
  - NodeJS
- Hardware :
  - [Two Way Mirror](http://fr.aliexpress.com/item/300mm-x-300mm-x-3-0mm-Acrylic-PMMA-Plexiglass-Partial-Translucent-Mirrored-Sheets-for-Infinity-illusion/32398641282.html)
  - Raspberry pi
  - Camera (I'm using the NoIR but any camera should do)
  - LED Monitor (Preferably that cover the whole surface of your two way mirror)

### Building
- Web server :
  - `npm install`
  - `node server.js`
  - go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Motion server :
  - Install OpenCV 2.x and cv2 wrapper for python (should be in the opencv package)
  - `pip install numpy`
  - `pip install tornado`
  - `python test.py` for debug infos or `python main.py` for silent process
  - `config.py` for the tracking settings
    - To use the Pi Camera set `useCameraBoard.piCamera` in config.py to true and install the package picamera `pip install "picamera[array]"`
  
### Notes
The motion server was made in python to learn the language, but it should have been made in C/C++ to gain execution speed and flowness in the gestures recognitions.
Also, python environment kinda sucks at the moment, the difficulty to set it up for python3 + opencv2 + windows and then linux was exhausting, I don't recommend.
