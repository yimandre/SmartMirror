# MirrorProject

This project is part of my 3rd year project. It contains all files relative to the GUI of the project. This application uses Darksky and skycons for weather information, as well as the google calendar api to display user events. The time and date information is processed with moment.js, for event data.

This has no auto build besides the npm standard. It will need the inclusion of several dependencies. This is probably not going to change as this is a proof of concept project, and can be weird. This was built specifically for use on the Raspberry Pi, and the layout files are not meant to be for other screen sizes.
