# MirrorProject
An open project was proposed to the team with the usage of a micro-controller. The idea of the Smart Mirror stemmed from the daily inconveniences that may occur while getting ready in front of the mirror. This project used a Raspberry Pi 2 which controlled the flow of real-time information that was displayed on the monitor. Through the knowledge of Python and Java programming, an intuitive user interface was produced, allowing all users of all ages to operate. Implementation of hand gesture recognition to operate the interface. This application uses Darksky and skycons for weather information, as well as the google calendar api to display user events. The time and date information is processed with moment.js, for event data.

This has no auto build besides the npm standard. It will need the inclusion of several dependencies. This is probably not going to change as this is a proof of concept project, and can be weird. This was built specifically for use on the Raspberry Pi, and the layout files are not meant to be for other screen sizes.
